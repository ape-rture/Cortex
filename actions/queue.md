- [ ] **Create business plan: AI for business**
  - ID: task-2026-02-19-ai-for-business
  - Status: queued
  - Priority: p2
  - Notes: There's a mass delusion on X that companies are building their own software "to save $20/mo". Companies do build their own tools, but here are the real reasons why. I've built custom AI tools for over a dozen companies. Zero of our clients hired us to save $$. All wanted custom because: 1. No solution to their problem existed. Buying an application is almost always cheaper than building it. However, if none fit your needs, build is the best option. And if you're building an AI application or agent, it can be a big revenue generator. 2. Horizontal tools cost too much money to build and maintain. VC funded and publicly traded companies need to reach mass scale. So they build a platform that's basically just a framework that helps you build what you actually need. Salesforce is affordable, but the subscription is just the ante. You then have to hire RevOps people to build and maintain it for you. 3. Companies want to build AI-native muscles. Most companies won't build their own tools any time soon. But those who can and do are positioned to perform exceptionally well in our AI-native future. 4. A year ago, building custom internal tools was out of reach for most companies. Today, a small team can ship a powerful AI tool in weeks, thanks to Claude Code and Cursor. This is "Jevons Paradox" in action. As cost goes down, demand doesn't stay the same, it increases to fill in the gaps of custom builds that used to be cost prohibitive. Building company-specific AI is also far easier than building horizontal or even vertical-specific AI because of user and data diversity. 5. Most people have no idea how loosey-goosey startups are with customer data. When you buy software from a startup, you're not just giving your data to that team, you're giving it to all of their vendors, contractors, and hackers. Last year, Google Cloud reported on "Widespread Data Theft" that targeted Salesforce instances via Salesloft Drift. Building reduces your data risk surface area. 6. Only about 10% of seed-funded startups raise a Series A round. Almost all of the rest shut down or get acqui-hired and then shut down. Gutting and replacing tools is a pain. When you build, you own and control your tools. AI, like people, is a huge leverage point, so it's probably worth making a core competency. 7. AI is great at code. Not as good at navigating UI or even 3rd party APIs. When you own the code of your tools, it's easier for agents to operate them. NOTE: I'm not saying build everything, buy nothing. I buy several AI products and a couple legacy SaaS products and recommend clients do the same. Large Language Models for example are a slam dunk buy over build. But the old build vs buy framework is broken. It's time to re-imagine what's possible now.

  - Description: Built a pretty sick (and simple!) meeting prep tool with Claude Code. Every morning at 7am it researches everyone I'm meeting with that day and drops a dossier in my inbox. Here's the exact workflow (copy-paste to Claude Code to build your own): - Railway cron triggers the workflow before your meetings start for the day - use Unipile's calendar API to pull today's Google Calendar events (filter out your own email and skip cancelled meetings to isolate external attendees) - run Exa in parallel on each attendee to find their LinkedIn URL and company website using the email domain as a search hint - hit Perplexity simultaneously for a live 2-3 sentence bio on the person and a 2-3 sentence company summary so both requests fire at the same time per attendee - pipe all four research outputs to Claude and get back a clean plain text dossier with one section per person and one per company (can do JS formatter that strips markdown and slots everything into a template if you want simpler) - Resend delivers one email per meeting with the title and time in the subject line so it's instantly scannable when it hits your inbox
