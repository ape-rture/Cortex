# Content Chains

Track cross-platform content recycling. A chain links original content to its derivatives.

Example chain: podcast episode -> YouTube description + @indexingco tweet + @ape_rture longform post

_No chains yet. Chains are created when content is derived from existing content (e.g., podcast distribution packs)._
